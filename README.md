# javascript-challenges
I'm trying to get better at Javascript and my friend is helping me work on programming problems. I wanted to better keep track of the problems I'm doing and the solutions that I've come up with.

So far, the challenges come from a website called "adriann.github.io" and from personal conversations from my friend. I plan to continue to seek more challenges from other sources, and possibly start writing my own at some point.

The goal is to become more skilled in programming with JavaScript every single day.
